This is a data management plan for GRAD521.

The project is to study the the inhibitory effects of free fatty acids against germination, outgrowth and vegetative growth of spores of Clostridium perfringens.

Clostridium perfringens type F is the causative agent of C. perfringens type F food poisoning (FP), which is the third most common foodborne disease in the United States. C. perfringens spores are highly heat-resistant and are able to germinate in foods during slow cooling or storage at ambient temperature. It is necessary to develop new strategies, such as chemical preservatives as an alternative to thermal processing, to inactivate C. perfringens spore growth in food products. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the inhibitory effects of four free fatty acids (FA) (butyric acid, octanoic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid) against germination, outgrowth and vegetative growth of spores of C. perfringens FP isolates in Tripticase-glucose-yeast extract (TGY) medium and spore growth in chicken meat.
