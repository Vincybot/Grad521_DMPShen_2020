# Data Management Plan

# Data description:

This research project is to test the inhibitory effects of free fatty acids against germination, outgrowth and vegetative growth of spores of Clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning disease.The experimats are divided into four subjects: Spore germination experiments, spore outgrowth experiments, vegetative growth experiments and meat experimants. For germination experiments, we use microplate reader to detect the change in absorbance of the light after the inculation of spores. The reader outputs excel spreadsheets (".xslx") to record the data. And in other three parts, we have to record the data by hand and input the number in excel spreadsheets. A spectrophotometer is used to monitor the change in density of the bacterium culture and record the number in spreadsheet. And then, we incubate the spores on the chicken meat and count the number of colonies after 18 hour. The value of colony-forming unit（CFU) per gram of chicken meat is recorded in spreadsheets. The raw data of the experimental results are stored in the comuper located in lab. And all the analysis will be applied on the copy of the raw data on the researcher's computer.

The total size of the data files is about 200 MB, and the majority is occupied for the resarch articles (".pdf"). The data stored in spreadsheets is approximately 1.1 MB. All data is digital data.


# Roles and responsibilities

In this project, PI and the researcher are responsible in the implementation of the DMP.
The responsibilities of data management in this project can be divided into three parts: 1) data collection, documentation and analysis; 2) access control; 3) data quality control. 
The researcher is responsible in the completion of experiments and data collection, documentation and analysis. Other graduate students who have graduated taught the researcher the data analysis method in lab.
The PI, Dr. Sarker, is taking the responsibility for coordinating and ensuring data storage and access. However, all the students working in this lab share the data storage and access together, so everyone in this lab share the responsibility for protection of the data stored in the lab’s computer. 
Both PI and the researcher should control the data quality and are responsible for making sure that the DMP is being followed.
For data sharing, as the project is funded by USDA and our lab is supported by OSU, the data sharing policy is regulated by USDA and OSU.
The data is collected by microbiology experiments, so it is not sensitive or confidential.

# Data standards and metadata
The data standards used in this project is according to the Project Open Data Metadata Schema v1.1 (https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/). These data formats and standards are introduced by USDA data management requirements.

The data types are as following:
* poster design and powerpoint presentations (.pptx)
* excel spreadsheet (.xlsx)
* photos of experiment (.png)
* plots of analysis (.fig)
* research articles (.pdf)
* documents (.docx)

All files should be named with a title including aim and date of creation. And in the spreadsheet, the date should be recorded in a format of year-month-day and the value of cells should only be numbers and marks.

# Storage and Backup

## Storage

After examinations are done, data will be stored in three places and updated when new data is collected.

On the computer in lab at Oregon State University.
This will be the working copy. As usually, the size of these data documents is less than 100KB, there is enough space in the lab computer for data storage, and we haven’t deleted any data, even for the data collected by several students who have graduated from OSU for more than 10 years.

On the onedrive of the head of the laboratory provided by Oregon State University.
A copy of recent data will be sent to the email box of the head of the laboratory every week. And the updated data will be stored in the onedrive of the head of the laboratory. Data will not be deleted until 5 years after the completion of the project.

On the personal computer of the researcher.
A second copy of recent data will be stored on the computer of the researcher who is responsible in data collecting. Data will not be deleted until 5 years after the completion of the project.

## Backup

These three storage locations are the places where data can be read. If data stored in one of the locations is destroyed, we still can get all the files from the other two places.

# Access and Data sharing

As the data in this project is not open for the public, the access will be limited to several specific methods. First, the research are funded by USDA and Oregon State University, so the raw data is only available with the permission from these two institutions. Second, after prior review, the data will be allowed to be published as an article on a journal, so part of the data is only available to the researchers who can get the access to readings published on the journal. 

# Archiving and Preservation

The data is stored in three different locations, lab computer, Onedrive provided by OSU, and personal computer. After the project is finished, the data stored in the computer lab will not be removed in 10 years, even after the updates of the lab equipments. The data stored in personal computer and on the Onedrive will remain for five years. The poster made for the introduction of the project will be preserved in the lab and all preservation will be supported by new coming students and the PI.
